// N.B. This is ideally temporary. It is currently used by Intel PT and PM
// support, and is a stopgap until "resources" can be used to read/write
// x86 MSRs. The intent is to use this interface for similar facilities in
// ARM (assuming we need it - on x86 we need ring 0 to access most of the
// MSRs we need).
// Note on naming: The "m" in "mtrace" means "miscellaneous". "trace" is being
// used very generically, e.g., all the different kinds of h/w based trace
// and performance data capturing one can do.
