// Kernel counters are a facility designed to help field diagnostics and
// to help devs properly dimension the load/clients/size of the kernel
// constructs. It answers questions like:
//   - after N seconds how many outstanding <x> things are allocated?
//   - up to this point has <Y> ever happened?
//
// Currently the only query interface to the counters is the console
// k counters command. Issue 'k counters help' to learn what it can do.
//
// Kernel counters public API:
// 1- define a new counter.
//      KCOUNTER(counter_name, "<counter name>");
//
// 2- counters start at zero, increment the counter:
//      kcounter_add(counter_name, 1);
//
//
// Naming the counters
// The naming convention is "kernel.subsystem.thing_or_action"
// for example "kernel.dispatcher.destroy"
//             "kernel.exceptions.fpu"
//             "kernel.handles.new"
//
//  Reading the counters in code
//  Don't. The counters are mantained in a per-cpu arena and
//  atomic operations are never used to set their value so
//  they are both imprecise and reflect only the operations
//  on a particular core.

// Because of -fdata-sections, each kcounter_arena_* array will be

// and places them all together to become the contiguous kcounters_arena
// array.  Note that each kcounter_arena_* does not correspond with the
// slots used for this particular counter (that would have terrible
// cache effects); it just reserves enough space for counters_init() to
// dole out in per-CPU chunks.
