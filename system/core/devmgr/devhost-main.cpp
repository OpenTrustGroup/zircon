// All drivers have a pure C ABI.  But each individual driver might statically
// link in its own copy of some C++ library code.  Since no C++ language
// relationships leak through the driver ABI, each driver is its own whole
// program from the perspective of the C++ language rules.  But the ASan
// runtime doesn't understand this and wants to diagnose ODR violations when
// the same global is defined in multiple drivers, which is likely with C++
// library use.  There is no real way to teach the ASan instrumentation or
// runtime about symbol visibility and isolated worlds within the program, so
// the only thing to do is suppress the ODR violation detection.  This
// unfortunately means real ODR violations within a single C++ driver won't be
// caught either.
