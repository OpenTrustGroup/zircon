List of TODOs :
-------------
1) The Amlogic controller is capable of irq driven writes and erases,
however this is not well documented (need to discuss with Cheng on the
specifics on how to do that). The controller driver uses polling with
usleep() for write and erase completions. irq driven completions
should be a measurable win.
2) Eliminate copy in read/write. Right now, the DMA is done to/from a
buffer inside the amlogic controller driver, and then the data is
copied to/from the supplied vmo. DMA'ing directly to the mapped vmo
address needs to be investigated and done.
3) Eliminate some wasteful usleep()s in the command/status code in the
driver.
4) We really only want to support read/write data+oob in one IO
support in the NAND protocol (it is not possible to write data and oob
separately to a page). We should eliminate the other read/write
variants (and all the code to support that).

Running the NAND unit test :
--------------------------
The NAND unit test depends on ability to create files in /tmp. The
following patch is needed to be able to do this.
