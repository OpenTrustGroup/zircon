// This interface consists of three groups of methods:
//
// - Waiting for signals: |begin_wait|, |cancel_wait|
// - Posting tasks: |post_task|, |cancel_task|
// - Queuing packets: |queue_packet|
//
// Implementations of this interface are not required to support all of these methods.
// Unsupported methods must have valid (non-null) function pointers, must have
// no side-effects, and must return |ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED| when called.
// Furthermore, if an implementation supports one method of a group, such as |begin_wait|,
// it must also support the other methods of the group, such as |cancel_wait|.
//
// Many clients assume that the dispatcher interface is fully implemented and may
// fail to work with dispatchers that do not support the methods they need.
// Therefore general-purpose dispatcher implementations are strongly encouraged to
// support the whole interface to ensure broad compatibility.
