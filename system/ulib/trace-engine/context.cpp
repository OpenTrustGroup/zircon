// Notes on buffering modes
// ------------------------
//
// Threads and strings are cached to improve performance and reduce buffer
// usage. The caching involves emitting separate records that identify
// threads/strings and then refering to them by a numeric id. For performance
// each thread in the application maintains its own cache.
//
// Oneshot: The trace buffer is just one large buffer, and records are written
// until the buffer is full after which all further records are dropped.
//
// Circular:
// The trace buffer is effectively divided into two pieces, and tracing begins
// by writing to the first piece. Once one buffer fills we start writing to the
// other one. This results in half the buffer being dropped at every switch,
// but simplifies things because we don't have to worry about varying record
// lengths.
//
// Streaming:
// The trace buffer is effectively divided into two pieces, and tracing begins
// by writing to the first piece. Once one buffer fills we start writing to the
// other buffer, if it is available, and notify the handler that the buffer is
// full. If the other buffer is not available, then records are dropped until
// it becomes available. The other buffer is unavailable between the point when
// it filled and when the handler reports back that the buffer's contents have
// been saved.
//
// There are two important properties we wish to preserve in circular and
// streaming modes:
// 1) We don't want records describing threads and strings to be dropped:
// otherwise records refering to them will have nothing to refer to.
// 2) We don't want thread records to be dropped at all: Fidelity of recording
// of all traced threads is important, even if some of their records are
// dropped.
// To implement both (1) and (2) we introduce a third buffer that holds
// records we don't want to drop called the "durable buffer". Threads and
// small strings are recorded there. The two buffers holding normal trace
// output are called "rolling buffers", as they fill we roll from one to the
// next. Thread and string records typically aren't very large, the durable
// buffer can hold a lot of records. To keep things simple, until there's a
// compelling reason to do something more, once the durable buffer fills
// tracing effectively stops, and all further records are dropped.
// Note: The term "rolling buffer" is intended to be internal to the trace
// engine/reader/manager and is not intended to appear in public APIs
// (at least not today).
//
// The protocol between the trace engine and the handler for saving buffers in
// streaming mode is as follows:
// 1) Buffer fills -> handler gets notified via
//    |trace_handler_ops::notify_buffer_full()|. Two arguments are passed
//    along with this request:
//    |wrapped_count| - records how many times tracing has wrapped from one
//    buffer to the next, and also records the current buffer which is the one
//    needing saving. Since there are two rolling buffers, the buffer to save
//    is |wrapped_count & 1|.
//    |durable_data_end| - records how much data has been written to the
//    durable buffer thus far. This data needs to be written before data from
//    the rolling buffers is written so string and thread references work.
// 2) The handler receives the "notify_buffer_full" request.
// 3) The handler saves new durable data since the last time, saves the
//    rolling buffer, and replies back to the engine via
//    |trace_engine_mark_buffer_saved()|.
// 4) The engine receives this notification and marks the buffer as now empty.
//    The next time the engine tries to allocate space from this buffer it will
//    succeed.
// Note that the handler is free to save buffers at whatever rate it can
// manage. The protocol allows for records to be dropped if buffers can't be
// saved fast enough.
