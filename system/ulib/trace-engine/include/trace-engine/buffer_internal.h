// This header provides framing information about the buffer, for use in
// implementing circular buffering and double(streaming) buffering.
//
// Writing to the buffer has conceptually three modes:
// oneshot, circular, streaming.
//
// Buffers are passed from Trace Manager to Trace Provider in vmos.
// How the buffer is treated depends on the writing mode.
// For "oneshot" mode the vmo is one big simple buffer.
//   Using one big buffer means durable and non-durable records all share the
//   same buffer.
//   For simplicity in the code, oneshot mode uses rolling buffer 0.
// For "circular" and "streaming" buffering modes, the vmo is treated as a
// "virtual buffer" and is split into three logical parts:
//   - one buffer for "durable" records
//   - two buffers, labeled 0 and 1, for "non-durable" records, called
//     "rolling buffers"
// Writing switches back and forth between the two rolling buffers as each
// fills. Streaming buffering differs from circular buffering in that the Trace
// Manager is involved in saving each rolling buffer as it fills.
// Besides consistency, a nice property of using two separate buffers for
// circular mode is that, because records are variable sized, there are no
// issues trying to find the "first" non-durable record in the complete virtual
// buffer after a wrap: It's always the first record of the other rolling
// buffer.
//
// To help preserve data integrity tracing stops when the durable buffer fills,
// even in circular mode.
// TODO(dje): Relax this restriction, and accept potentially more lost data.
//
// Durable records:
// - initialization record
// - string table
// - thread table
// TODO(dje): Move initialization record to header?
//
// Non-durable records:
// - everything else
//
// The total physical buffer is laid out as follows (without gaps):
// - header
// - durable buffer (empty in oneshot mode)
// - non-durable buffer 0
// - non-durable buffer 1 (empty in oneshot mode)
//
// It is an invariant that:
// oneshot:
//   total_size == header + rolling_buffer_size
// circular/streaming:
//   total_size == header + durable_buffer_size + 2 * rolling_buffer_size
//
// All buffer sizes must be a multiple of 8 as all records are a multiple of 8.
