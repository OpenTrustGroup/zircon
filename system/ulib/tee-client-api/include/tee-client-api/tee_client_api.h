 *                              of the Operation and is tagged as input.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_OUTPUT      Same as TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_INPUT, but the Memory Reference is tagged
 *                              as output. The Implementation may update the size field to reflect
 *                              the required output size in some use cases.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_INOUT       A Temporary Memory Reference tagged as both input and output, i.e.,

/* Session Login Methods
 *
 * These are used to indicate what identity credentials about the Client Application are used by
 * the Implementation to determine access control permissions to functionality provided by, or data
 * stored by, the Trusted Application.
 *
 * Login types are designed to be orthogonal from reach other, in accordance with the identity
 * token(s) defined for each constant. For example, the credentials generated for
 * TEEC_LOGIN_APPLICATION must only depend on the identity of the application program, and not the
 * user running it. If two users use the same program, the Implementation must assign the same
 * login identity to both users so that they can access the same assets held inside the TEE. These
 * identity tokens must also be persistent within one Implementation, across multiple invocations of
 * the application and across power cycles, enabling them to be used to disambiguate persistent
 * storage. Note that this specification does not guarantee separation based on use of different
 * login types - in many embedded platforms there is no notion of "group" or "user" so these login
 * types may fall back to TEEC_LOGIN_PUBLIC - these details of generating the credential for each
 * login type are implementation-defined.
 *
 * TEEC_LOGIN_PUBLIC            No login data is provided.
 * TEEC_LOGIN_USER              Login data about the user running the Client Application process is

 * TEEC_LOGIN_APPLICATION       Login data about the running Client Application itself is provided.

 *
 * This function invokes a Command within the specified Session.

 * Parameters:
 * session      The open Session in which the command will be invoked.
 * commandID    The identifier of the Command within the Trusted Application to invoke. The meaning
 *              of each Command Identifier must be defined in the protocol exposed by the Trusted
 *              Application.
 * operation    A pointer to a Client Application initialized TEEC_Operation structure, or NULL if
 *              there is no payload to send or if the Command does not need to support cancellation.
 * returnOrigin A pointer to a variable which will contain the return origin. This field may be NULL
 *              if the return origin is not needed.
 *
 * Return:
 * TEEC_Result  * If the returnOrigin is different from TEEC_ORIGIN_TRUSTED_APP, a TEEC Return Code.
 *              * If the returnOrigin is TEEC_ORIGIN_TRUSTED_APP, a return code defined by the
 *                Trusted Application protocol.
