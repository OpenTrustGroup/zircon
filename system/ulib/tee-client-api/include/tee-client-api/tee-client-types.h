 *      than or equal to 512kB. In systems where there is no limit imposed by the Implementation
 *      then this definition should be defined to be the size of the address space.

 *
 * These are used to indicate the type of Parameter encoded inside the operation structure.
 *
 * TEEC_NONE                    The Parameter is not used.
 * TEEC_VALUE_INPUT             The Parameter is a TEEC_Value tagged as input.
 * TEEC_VALUE_OUTPUT            The Parameter is a TEEC_Value tagged as output.
 * TEEC_VALUE_INOUT             The Parameter is a TEEC_Value tagged as both as input and output,

 *                              TEEC_VALUE_OUTPUT apply.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_INPUT       The Parameter is a TEEC_TemporaryMemoryReference describing a region
 *                              of memory which needs to be temporarily registered for the duration
 *                              of the Operation and is tagged as input.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_OUTPUT      Same as TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_INPUT, but the Memory Reference is tagged
 *                              as output. The Implementation may update the size field to reflect
 *                              the required output size in some use cases.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_INOUT       A Temporary Memory Reference tagged as both input and output, i.e.,
 *                              for which both the behaviors of TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_INPUT and
 *                              TEEC_MEMREF_TEMP_OUTPUT apply.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_WHOLE            The Parameter is a Registered Memory Reference that refers to the
 *                              entirety of its parent Shared Memory block. The parameter structure
 *                              is a TEEC_RegisteredMemoryReference. In this structure, the

 * TEEC_MEMREF_PARTIAL_INPUT    A Registered Memory Reference structure that refers to a partial
 *                              region of its parent Shared Memory block and is tagged as input.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_PARTIAL_OUTPUT   A Registered Memory Reference structure that refers to a partial
 *                              region of its parent Shared Memory block and is tagged as output.
 * TEEC_MEMREF_PARTIAL_INOUT    The Registered Memory Reference structure that refers to a partial
 *                              region of its parent Shared Memory block and is tagged as both
 *                              input and output, i.e., for which both the behaviors of

/* Session Login Methods
 *
 * These are used to indicate what identity credentials about the Client Application are used by
 * the Implementation to determine access control permissions to functionality provided by, or data
 * stored by, the Trusted Application.
 *
 * Login types are designed to be orthogonal from reach other, in accordance with the identity
 * token(s) defined for each constant. For example, the credentials generated for
 * TEEC_LOGIN_APPLICATION must only depend on the identity of the application program, and not the
 * user running it. If two users use the same program, the Implementation must assign the same
 * login identity to both users so that they can access the same assets held inside the TEE. These
 * identity tokens must also be persistent within one Implementation, across multiple invocations of
 * the application and across power cycles, enabling them to be used to disambiguate persistent
 * storage. Note that this specification does not guarantee separation based on use of different
 * login types - in many embedded platforms there is no notion of "group" or "user" so these login
 * types may fall back to TEEC_LOGIN_PUBLIC - these details of generating the credential for each
 * login type are implementation-defined.
 *
 * TEEC_LOGIN_PUBLIC            No login data is provided.
 * TEEC_LOGIN_USER              Login data about the user running the Client Application process is
 *                              provided.
 * TEEC_LOGIN_GROUP             Login data about the group running the Client Application process is

 * TEEC_LOGIN_APPLICATION       Login data about the running Client Application itself is provided.
 * TEEC_LOGIN_USER_APPLICATION  Login data about the user running the Client Application and about
 *                              the Client Application itself is provided.
 * TEEC_LOGIN_GROUP_APPLICATION Login data about the group running the Client Application and about
 *                              the Client Application itself is provided.
