// service.  See system/fidl/fuchsia-ldsvc/ldsvc.fidl for a definition of the protocol.
//
// These implementations are compatible with |dl_set_loader_service| and are
// primarily used by devmgr, fshost, and appmgr to provide shared libraries to
// the processes they create.
//
// Terms:
//
// "loader service": A channel that speaks the protocol expected by
//     dl_set_loader_service(). The service behind the channel receives
//     load requests (e.g., "libhid.so") and returns VMOs that contain
//     the data associated with that name.
// "system loader service": A loader service, provided by the system,
//     that is shared by multiple processes.
