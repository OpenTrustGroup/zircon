# This file is used by scripts/download-prebuilt to control cipd.  When
# cipd is not available, it uses zircon.versions instead to deduce URLs to
# download directly from Google Storage.
#
# This file is the source of truth and the bits in CIPD are the canonical
# bits.  They're also copied to Google Storage with URLs derived from the
# CIPD package name (shown below, with $ substituions for platform) and
# instance ID (which is the SHA1 of the file).  zircon.versions is
# generated from this file by querying CIPD to gather the instance IDs.
#
# NOTE! NOTE! NOTE!  After changing this file in any way, always run
# scripts/update-prebuilt-versions to update the zircon.versions file with
# specific instance IDs for each version listed here.  The two files must
# be kept in lock-step so that scripts/download-prebuilt gets the same
# contents whether it uses cipd or direct downloads.

# These lines tell scripts/update-prebuilt-versions what to look for.
