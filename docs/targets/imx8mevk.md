## Flashing Zircon on eMMC:

The board will boot out of eMMC by default. In order to boot Zircon, a custom u-boot binary
is needed. The binary can be found at: go/imx8m-bootloader

First step involves flashing the board with the custom u-boot binary:

# Requirements:
 + Linux Host Machine
 + Connect USB cable from the USB-C port on the board to your host
 + Create a file under /etc/udev/rules.d/70-nxp.rules with the following content:

 SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0525", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev", TAG+="uaccess"


# From Device (iMX8 EVK):

+ Reboot board and press space to halt autoboot
+ From u-boot command line do the following:
    + fastboot 0

# From Linux Host:
 + fastboot flash bootloader0 /PATH/TO/CUSTOM/UBOOT/u-boot.imx
 + fastboot reboot

 If successful, the new U-Boot prompt should be "zircon-u-boot=>"

Once the custom U-Boot has been flashed, perform the following:
+ Reboot board and press space to halt autoboot
+ From u-boot command line do the following:
    + fastboot 0

From the host side, go to your zircon repository and run the following commnand:
+ ./scripts/flash-nxp

If successful, the board will reboot into Zircon.
