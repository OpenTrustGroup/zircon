# zx_thread_create

## NAME

thread_create - create a thread

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_thread_create(zx_handle_t process, const char* name, size_t name_size,
                             uint32_t options, zx_handle_t* out);

```

## DESCRIPTION

**thread_create**() creates a thread within the specified process.

Upon success a handle for the new thread is returned.  The thread
will not start executing until *thread_start()* is called.

*name* is silently truncated to a maximum of *ZX_MAX_NAME_LEN-1* characters.

Thread handles may be waited on and will assert the signal
*ZX_THREAD_TERMINATED* when the thread stops executing (due to
*thread_exit**() being called).

*process* is the controlling [process object](../objects/process.md) for the
new thread, which will become a child of that process.

For thread lifecycle details see [thread object](../objects/thread.md).

## RIGHTS

TODO(ZX-2399)

## RETURN VALUE

On success, **thread_create**() returns **ZX_OK** and a handle (via *out*)
to the new thread.  In the event of failure, a negative error value is
returned.

## ERRORS

**ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *process* is not a valid handle.

**ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *process* is not a process handle.

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *name* or *out* was an invalid pointer, or *options* was
non-zero.

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
There is no good way for userspace to handle this (unlikely) error.
In a future build this error will no longer occur.
