# zx_channel_write

## NAME

channel_write - write a message to a channel

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_channel_write(zx_handle_t handle, uint32_t options,
                             void* bytes, uint32_t num_bytes,
                             zx_handle_t* handles, uint32_t num_handles);
```

## DESCRIPTION

**channel_write**() attempts to write a message of *num_bytes*
bytes and *num_handles* handles to the channel specified by
*handle*.  The pointers *handles* and *bytes* may be NULL if their
respective sizes are zero.

On success, all *num_handles* of the handles in the *handles* array
are no longer accessible to the caller's process -- they are attached
to the message and will become available to the reader of that message
from the opposite end of the channel.  On any failure, all handles
are discarded rather than transferred.

It is invalid to include *handle* (the handle of the channel being written
to) in the *handles* array (the handles being sent in the message).

The maximum number of handles which may be sent in a message is
**ZX_CHANNEL_MAX_MSG_HANDLES**, which is 64.

The maximum number of bytes which may be sent in a message is
**ZX_CHANNEL_MAX_MSG_BYTES**, which is 65536.


## RIGHTS

*handle* must have **ZX_RIGHT_WRITE**.

Each of the handles in *handles* must have **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**.

## RETURN VALUE

**channel_write**() returns **ZX_OK** on success.

## ERRORS

**ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *handle* is not a valid handle, any element in
*handles* is not a valid handle, or there are duplicates among the handles
in the *handles* array.

**ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *handle* is not a channel handle.

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *bytes* is an invalid pointer, *handles*
is an invalid pointer, or *options* is nonzero.

**ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED**  *handle* was found in the *handles* array, or
one of the handles in *handles* was *handle* (the handle to the
channel being written to).

**ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED**  *handle* does not have **ZX_RIGHT_WRITE** or
any element in *handles* does not have **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**.

**ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED**  The other side of the channel is closed.

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
There is no good way for userspace to handle this (unlikely) error.
In a future build this error will no longer occur.

**ZX_ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE**  *num_bytes* or *num_handles* are larger than the
largest allowable size for channel messages.

## NOTES

*num_handles* is a count of the number of elements in the *handles*
array, not its size in bytes.

The byte size limitation on messages is not yet finalized.
