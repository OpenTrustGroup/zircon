# zx_timer_create

## NAME

timer_create - create a timer

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_timer_create(uint32_t options, uint32_t clock_id, zx_handle_t* out);

```

## DESCRIPTION

**timer_create**() creates a timer, an object that can signal
when a specified point in time has been reached. The only valid
*clock_id* is ZX_CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

The *options* value specifies the coalescing behavior which
controls whether the system can fire the time earlier or later
depending on other pending timers.

The possible values are:

+ **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_CENTER** coalescing is allowed with earlier and
  later timers.
+ **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_EARLY** coalescing is allowed only with earlier
  timers.
+ **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_LATE** coalescing is allowed only with later
  timers.

Passing 0 in options is equivalent to ZX_TIMER_SLACK_CENTER.

The returned handle has the ZX_RIGHT_DUPLICATE, ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER,
ZX_RIGHT_READ and ZX_RIGHT_WRITE right.

## RIGHTS

TODO(ZX-2399)

## RETURN VALUE

**timer_create**() returns **ZX_OK** on success. In the event
of failure, a negative error value is returned.

## ERRORS

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *out* is an invalid pointer or NULL or
*options* is not one of the ZX_TIMER_SLACK values or *clock_id* is
any value other than ZX_CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
There is no good way for userspace to handle this (unlikely) error.
In a future build this error will no longer occur.
